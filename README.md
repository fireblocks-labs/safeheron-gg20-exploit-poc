[SafeHeron-GG20-Exploit-Development-Explainer.pdf](SafeHeron-GG20-Exploit-Development-Explainer.pdf) contains a detailed explanation of the exploit development process.

## Build
Before you can run the exploit, you need to first install the prerequisites described below, and then compile the code by running the following commands:
```shell
git clone https://github.com/orenyomtov/safeheron-gg20-exploit-poc.git
cd safeheron-gg20-exploit-poc
git submodule update --recursive --init
mkdir build && cd build
cmake ..  -DENABLE_TESTS=ON
# Add the path to the LD_LIBRARY_PATH environment variable on Mac OS; Ignore it on Linux
export LIBRARY_PATH=$LIBRARY_PATH:/usr/local/lib/
make
```

## Run
```
ctest --verbose
```
